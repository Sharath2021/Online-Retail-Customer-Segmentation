# Online-Retail-Customer-Segmentation

We live in a world where large and vast amount of datais collected daily. Analysing such data is an important need. In the modern era of innovation, where there is a large competition to be better then everyone, the business strategy needs to be according to the modern conditions. The business done today runs on the basis of innovative ideas as there are large number of potential customers who are confounded to what to buy and what not to buy. The companies doing thebusiness are also not able to diagnose the target potential customers. This is where the machine learning comes into picture, the various algorithms areapplied to identify the hidden patterns in the data for better decision making. The concept of which customer segment to target is done using the customer segmentation process using the clustering technique. In this, the clustering algorithm used is K-means algorithm which is the partitioning algorithm, to segment the customers according to the similar characteristics. To determine the optimalclusters, elbow method is used.





The task is to identify major customer segments on a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

<p>I have developed a spam detector program in Python which classifies given emails as spam or ham using the Naive Bayes approach.</p>

<h2> :floppy_disk: Project Files Description</h2>

<p>This Project includes 3 executable files, 3 text files as well as 2 directories as follows:</p>
<h4>Executable Files:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>spam_detector.py</b> - Includes all functions required for classification operations.</li>
  <li><b>train.py</b> - Uses the functions defined in the spam_detector.py file and generates the model.txt file after execution.</li>
  <li><b>test.py</b> - Uses the functions defined in the spam_detector.py file and, after execution, generates the result.txt as well as evaluation.txt files.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Output Files:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>model.txt</b> - Contains information about the vocabularies of the train set, such as the frequency and conditional probability of each word in Spam and Ham classes.</li>
  <li><b>result.txt</b> - Contains information about the classified emails of the test set.</li>
  <li><b>evaluation.txt</b> - Contains evaluation results table as well as Confusion Matrix of Spam and Ham classes.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Source Directories:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>train directory</b> - Includes all emails for the training phase of the program.</li>
  <li><b>test directory</b> - Includes all emails for the testing phase of the program.</li>
</ul>

<h2> :book: Naive Bayes</h2>

<p>In machine learning, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.
Abstractly, naive Bayes is a conditional probability model: given a problem instance to be classified, represented by a vector
<img src="image/1.png" alt="Formula 1" style="max-width:100%;"></p>

<p>representing some n features (independent variables), it assigns to this instance probabilities
<img src="image/2.png" alt="Formula 2" style="max-width:100%;"></p>

<p>The problem with the above formulation is that if the number of features n is large or if a feature can take on a large number of values, then basing such a model on probability tables is infeasible. We therefore reformulate the model to make it more tractable. Using Bayes' theorem, the conditional probability can be decomposed as

<h2> :clipboard: Execution Instruction</h2>
<p>The order of execution of the program files is as follows:</p>
<p><b>1) spam_detector.py</b></p>
<p>First, the spam_detector.py file must be executed to define all the functions and variables required for classification operations.</p>
<p><b>2) train.py</b></p>
<p>Then, the train.py file must be executed, which leads to the production of the model.txt file. 
At the beginning of this file, the spam_detector has been imported so that the functions defined in it can be used.</p>
<p><b>3) test.py</b></p>
<p>Finally, the test.py file must be executed to create the result.txt and evaluation.txt files.
Just like the train.py file, at the beginning of this file, the spam_detector has been imported so that the functions defined in it can be used.</p>
